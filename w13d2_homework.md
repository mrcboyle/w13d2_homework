What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
Polymorphism means many changes.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
Polymorphism would allow us to make more than one Class have the same Type. 
An example would be various Classes of animals. By implenting Polymorphsim, we could could create a single combined ArrayList of all animals of different types. In turn, this would allow quicker/easy access to the list for processing.

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
Interfaces can be used to implement polymorphism.

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
Initially, I thought the answer to be multiple forms.
However, after making my way to StackOverlflow, I am not so sure...

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Same as answer 2 I think.

Composition and Aggregation
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Composition (from what I can gather) is when an object is broken down into smaller objects

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.


Give a difference between composition and aggregation?
With composition, one object is contained within another object. With Aggregation, one object is the owner of another object.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?


When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
They are destroyed too.

When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
They continue to exist.
